# Project 4-5: Around The U.S.

### Overview
* Most recent updates were made to project to complete the functionality of the modal through javascript, specifically adding a delete button on each image, adding functionality to all buttons, and adding two new pop up modals. 

**Description**

This is a project about world travel and adventure.  It highlights 6 specific areas around to world through the eyes of different explorers.  The website is responsive and functional through use of 3 pop-up boxes, and it was made using the BEM methodology, coded with primarily HTML, CSS and javascript.
